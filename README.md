# README.md Content for GTFS Insights Project

## General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)

The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a standardized format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. It provides valuable insights into transit systems by connecting various data feeds such as schedules, stops, routes, trips, and fare attributes. GTFS data is widely used in transit planning, optimization, and visualization to improve service delivery and enhance user experience.

## About This Project

This project aims to analyze GTFS data and derive insightful metrics for transit systems across different cities, such as Toronto, Dallas, Washington, Chicago, and more. The project is designed to simplify the process of analyzing GTFS feeds while ensuring developers gain a deep understanding of the data structure and relationships between the various GTFS feeds.

### Key Features

1. **Ease of Use**:  
   Developers simply need to place the correct version of the `GTFS.zip` file in the code folder. The script automatically processes the data and generates a detailed summary of insights in a PDF report.

2. **Comprehensive Insights**:  
   The project performs various calculations, visualizations, and clustering analyses to uncover meaningful patterns in the transit data.

3. **Educational Value**:  
   Unlike ready-made GTFS analysis packages, this project allows users to dive deeper into GTFS, understand its structure, and explore the relationships between different data feeds.

4. **Customizability**:  
   The project is flexible and can be extended to accommodate additional case studies and analyses in the future.

5. **Licensing**:  
   A `LICENSE.md` file is included to ensure proper usage and attribution of the project.

### Libraries and Skills Required

This project requires familiarity with the following libraries and tools:

- **File Handling**:  
  `os`, `zipfile`  
  To manage file directories and handle GTFS `.zip` files.

- **Data Manipulation**:  
  `pandas`, `numpy`  
  To process and analyze data efficiently.

- **Date and Time Calculations**:  
  `datetime`, `timedelta`  
  To handle scheduling data and compute time-based metrics.

- **Visualization**:  
  `folium`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`  
  For creating interactive maps, charts, and clustering visualizations.

- **PDF Generation**:  
  `FPDF`, `PIL`  
  To generate high-quality PDF reports summarizing the insights.

### Why Choose This Project?

While there are existing packages on the internet that can generate insights from GTFS, they abstract away much of the underlying data structure. By using this project, you not only derive insights but also gain a deeper understanding of:

- How GTFS works.
- The data it provides.
- Relationships between different feeds (e.g., trips, routes, stops).

This approach empowers users to explore GTFS beyond ready-made solutions, enabling them to design custom analyses and better understand transit systems.

### Future Work

We are actively working to extend this project to include additional case studies and transit systems, making it a valuable resource for transit planning and analysis worldwide.
